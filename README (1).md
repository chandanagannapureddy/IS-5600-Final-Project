This code creates a window with a label, button, and entry field. When the button is clicked, the text in the entry field is displayed on the label.

To run this code, you will need to have Tkinter installed. You can install it using pip install tkinter.



The code 2 defines a simple Flask app with a single route that retrieves a list of users from a MySQL database and returns the results as a JSON response.

To use this code, you will need to install the Flask and mysql-connector-python packages using pip. You will also need to replace the placeholders <username>, <password>, <hostname>, and <database> with the appropriate values for your database.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
